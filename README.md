# zdm_checklist
an Excel spreadsheet for tracking ZDM activities during Franchise visits.
Automation:
I have tried to automate some of the activities on the sheet, including:
Toggling an 'x' in the 'yes/no' columns by double clicking and flashing a message stating a comment is required when necessary.
The columns that require a comment have a background color of yellow, this is to allow the program to know when a comment is required.
The comment cell, in Column F will be given a background color of red to indcate a comment needs to be entered.
These comments are then transferred to the Summary sheet.  The Summary sheet also has a Column for additional notes or comments as needed.
On the Checklist sheet is a button labeled 'clear sheet'.  It does just what it says clears all 'x's and the red comment backgrounds, resetting the sheet for your next franchise visit.
